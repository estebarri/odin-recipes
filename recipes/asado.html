    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Asado Argentino is a traditional Argentine barbecue or grill, known for its distinctive cooking method, flavors, and social significance in Argentine culture. It's not just a type of food; it's a cultural and culinary experience that brings people together.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Assorted cuts of meat (ribs, sausages, flank steak, etc.)</li>
        <li>Coarse salt</li>
        <li>Chimichurri sauce (optional)</li>
        <li>Salad (optional)</li>
        <li>Bread (optional)</li>
        <li>Grilled vegetables (optional)</li>
        <li>Red wine (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Grill: If you're using charcoal, light the charcoal and wait until it's covered with white ash. If you're using a gas grill, preheat it to medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Season the Meat: Generously season the meat with coarse salt on both sides. Let the meat sit at room temperature for about 20-30 minutes to allow the salt to penetrate.</li>
        <li>Start Grilling: Place the meat on the grill over the hot coals or flames. For thicker cuts, you may want to start with the fat side down to render some of the fat and develop a nice sear.</li>
        <li>Monitor the Cooking: Keep an eye on the meat and adjust the heat as needed. The goal is to cook the meat slowly and evenly, allowing the flavors to develop. You can use a meat thermometer to check the internal temperature of thicker cuts.</li>
        <li>Chimichurri Sauce (Optional): While the meat is grilling, you can prepare the chimichurri sauce. In a bowl, mix chopped parsley, minced garlic, red pepper flakes, dried oregano, red wine vinegar, and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Let the flavors meld while the meat finishes cooking.</li>
        <li>Grill the Vegetables (Optional): If you're grilling vegetables, such as bell peppers, onions, or eggplant, you can do this alongside the meat. Brush the vegetables with olive oil and season with salt and pepper before grilling.</li>
        <li>Serve: Once the meat is cooked to your desired level of doneness, remove it from the grill and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing. Serve the grilled meat with chimichurri sauce, salads, bread, grilled vegetables, and red wine, if desired.</li>
        <li>Enjoy: Asado is a social event, so enjoy the meal with friends and family, sharing stories and savoring the flavors of the grilled meat and accompaniments.</li>
